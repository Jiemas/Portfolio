{"AboutMe":{"simple":["I’m a Christian, first-generation immigrant, and the youngest in a family of five! I recently graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a B.S. in Computer Science. During my time in college, I focused on software and full-stack web development, working on several projects for various courses, from a study tool to a data visualization dashboard for the UC Santa Cruz Police. I also had the opportunity to work with WordPress websites through jobs and internships. ","Additionally, my other job experiences have helped develop my non-technical skills. For example, my time as a LSS tutor has developed my interpersonal skills needed to work as a good team member. Right now, I’m hoping to work in the public sector, so I can utilize my skills for others!"]},"Experiences":{"e115a":{"BasicInformation":{"Location":"Santa Cruz, CA","RelatedOrganization":"UC Santa
